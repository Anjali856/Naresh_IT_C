# C Program to Print a Rectangle of Asterisks

This is a simple C program that takes the number of rows and columns as input from the user and prints a rectangle of asterisks (`*`) based on those inputs.

## Program Description

- The program first prompts the user to input the number of rows and columns for the rectangle.
- It then uses two nested loops: the outer loop controls the rows, and the inner loop controls the columns.
- The program prints an asterisk (`*`) for each column in every row, creating a rectangular pattern.
- The program runs until all the specified rows and columns have been printed.
